# Abstract

Bitcoin has eliminated trust when conducting peer-to-peer financial transactions by inventing the economic incentives and technology to run a decentralized computer network. Ethereum has invented Turing complete-programming for it, which helped create more complicated financial instruments, such as tokenized assets, collateralized loans, liquidity pools or synthetic assets. In this paper we describe the architecture, components, governance mechanism and financial model of Everscale blockchain â€” a trustless worldwide operating system.
