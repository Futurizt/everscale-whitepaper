> &#x20;       — The Declaration of Decentralization

Everscale is a decentralized global blockchain network launched on top of Ever OS on May 7, 2020. On November 10, 2021 by the decision of its community it was renamed to Everscale from Free TON. Its technology has roots in the TON blockchain, this will be discussed in some more details throughout this paper. Sometimes it was simply impractical to rename everything. For example, the TONIX blockchain UNIX file system was not renamed, etc.&#x20;

Everscale is a new and unique blockchain design that proposes a scalable decentralized world computer, paired with a distributed operating system — Ever OS.

Ever OS is capable of processing millions of transactions per second, with Turing-complete smart contracts and decentralized user interfaces.

Everscale presents some new and unique properties, such as dynamic multithreading, soft majority consensus and distributed programming, which enable it to be scalable, fast and secure at the same time. It is governed by a decentralized community founded upon meritocratic principles via Soft Majority Voting protocol.

Everscale has powerful developer tools, such as compilers for Solidity and C++, API, SDK that includes client libraries for 13 programming languages and all popular platforms, local node for DApp testing, CLI tools and  a range of decentralized browsers and wallets empowering many applications in DeFi, NFT, tokenization and governance domains.
