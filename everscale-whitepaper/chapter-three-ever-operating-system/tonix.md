# Tonix

Following the above a practical simulation of a UNIX filesystem has been implemented. Tonix provides basic file system functionality, as well as an interactive shell with a Unix-style command line interface. The following categories of operations are supported: query file system status, manage user session, manipulate files, change file attributes, process text, access reference manuals etc.
