# File names and directories

The Ever OS user should be able not only to call a program by internal processor address, but to use human readable names, store data not only in the contract internal memory but have access to some peripheral devices such as hard drives, long term storage and so on that would represent a natural functionality of an operating system kernel.&#x20;

File names and directories have been implemented by a protocol we call DeCert (Decentralized Certificates) in general and in particular DeNS (Decentralized Name Service).

The implementation of DeNS is an example of the Distributed Programming Paradigm of Everscale (see a special chapter below for more information) which provides an instant name  resolution.
